## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
1. **Wind Rotation ‚Üí Gear Motor**  
   - The wind rotates the turbine blades connected to a **gear motor**.  
   - The motor converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.  

2. **Current Protection**  
   - Electricity passes through a **1N4007 diode** to block reverse current flow.  

3. **Voltage Stabilization**  
   - The generated voltage is stabilized using **2 electrolytic capacitors (35V)** connected in parallel.  

4. **Voltage Regulation**  
   - A single **LM7805 voltage regulator** maintains a constant **5V output** for safe charging.  
   - An additional **25V filter capacitor** smoothens the regulator output.  

5. **Energy Storage & Usage**  
   - Energy is stored in **two rechargeable batteries**.  
   - A **socket** connects the battery to power the Arduino-based scrolling display.  
   - An **LED indicator** lights up whenever energy is being generated and stored.  

6. **Final Output**  
   - The stored energy powers the **scrolling LED display**, completing the cycle of wind-to-electricity conversion.
